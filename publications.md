# Publications

We occassionally write short reports and publications on the state of Quantitative Methods in Geography. These include:

[Quantitative Methods in Geography: Making the Connections between Schools, Universities and Employers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256191493_Quantitative_Methods_in_Geography_Making_the_Connections_between_Schools_Universities_and_Employers)

[Skills in Mathematics and Statistics in Geography and tackling transition](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Skills-in-Mathematics-and-Statistics-in-Geography-Souch-Fitzpatrick/8a401fd9168ea2747d796beb146a1b96614a7e92)

[Geographers Count: A Report on Quantitative Methods in Geography](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.11120/elss.2014.00035)

We have preserved the CATMOG (Concepts And Techniques in MOdern Geography) series [here](https://qmrg.github.io/CATMOG/). 

While not a publication per se, we also co-sponsor the *SAD interviews* which feature talks with eminent researchers in Spatial Analytics, Data, and Quantitative Geography. You can watch back all of the interviews [here](https://qmrg.github.io/sad_interviews).
