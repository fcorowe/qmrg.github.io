We occassionally write short reports and publications on the state of Quantitative Methods in Geography. These include:

[Quantitative Methods in Geography: Making the Connections between Schools, Universities and Employers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256191493_Quantitative_Methods_in_Geography_Making_the_Connections_between_Schools_Universities_and_Employers)

[Skills in Mathematics and Statistics in Geography and tackling transition](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Skills-in-Mathematics-and-Statistics-in-Geography-Souch-Fitzpatrick/8a401fd9168ea2747d796beb146a1b96614a7e92)

[Geographers Count: A Report on Quantitative Methods in Geography](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.11120/elss.2014.00035)

We have preserved the CATMOG (Concepts And Techniques in MOdern Geography) series [here](https://quantile.info/catmog/). The CATMOG reports describe advances in quantitative methods from the mid-1970s upto the early 1990s where many methods commonplace today were being developed. They represent core texts for those interested in the history behind quantitative methods in Geography. Writers include Stan Openshaw, Ron Johnston, Danny Dorling and many other renowned Quantitative Geographers.
