            <p class="center-text mega-margin">The Quantitative Methods Research Group (QMRG) is one of a number of Speciality Research Groups of the RGS-IBG. These Research and Study Groups bring together Society Fellows who are active researchers and those with a professional interest in a particular aspect of geography. The QMRG exists to promote the application of quantitative methods in Geography. It encompasses research across a broad range of topics in statistics and general quantitative modelling approaches. The QMRG has an extensive history which you can read about here. </p>
            <p class="center-text mega-margin">Membership of the QMRG is open to all Fellows (including Associate Fellows) of the RGS-IBG who elect to join the Research Group. Membership of the QMRG is free of charge except for those who are already a member of two further Research Groups where an additional fee may be required. Other interested persons who are not Fellows of the RGS-IBG may join the QMRG for an additional fee as determined by the QMRG AGM. The QMRG register now totals well over 200 members.</p>
