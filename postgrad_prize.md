All papers that are rpesented in these sessions are eligible for the prize, which is adjudicated by independent reviewers.

The prize is named in honour of Prof. Robin Flowerdew who made considerable contributions to quantitative methods in Geography, as well as having played an important role in promoting and supporting QMRG.
