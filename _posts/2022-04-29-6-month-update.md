As part of the QMRG's regular reporting to the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), we provide short updates on our activities every 6 months. This page details a summary of activities between October 2021 and March 2022. 
 
* We plan to sponsor four sessions in the RGS-IBG 2022 Annual Conference including two PGR sessions.
* We have launched an initiative to collaborate with AAG Spatial Analysis & Modelling ([SAM](http://sam-aag.org/)) Group for future international research/teaching collaborations.
* We are compiling a short history of the QMRG (1964 till now) and have published it [here](https://qmrg.github.io/history_of_qmrg).
* We provide two travel grants for under representative groups in this year’s GISRUK 2022 annual conference at April in Liverpool, together with GIS groups from RGS.
* We have set up a formal undergraduate dissertation prize plan and judge criterion with the new dissertation officer (Dr. Isabel Williams), and more details instructions will be published on our website on May. 
* Our postgraduate reps are working hard on producing a paper on early-career experiences/trajectories in quantitative geography. We believe this can be quite an important paper that many ECRs and PGRs can relate to it.
* We continue to have the “Spatial Analytics and Data” webinar sessions with Alan Turing Institute. We have both invited talks and interviews and the details can be found on our [website](https://qmrg.github.io/sad_interviews) and on their [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcf3cdwC1c-1w4Oq0J9yNIg).
