As part of the QMRG’s regular reporting to the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), we provide short updates on our activities every 6 months. This page details a summary of activities between October 2022 and March 2022.

- We inaugurated our new chair, [Prof. Francisco Rowe](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/environmental-sciences/staff/francisco-javier-rowe-gonzalez/), who began his tenure at the AGM. We give our thanks and congratulations to our outgoing chair, Prof. Daniel Arribas-Bel. 
- Our early-career researcher members—Laura Sheppard, Ruth Neville, and Yue Li—and our EDI coordinator, Dr. Catlin Robinson, have successfully started a useful and robust “Early Career Researcher” network to connect and support early-career researchers doing quantitative geography. The group has a mailing list, grew from a social held at the last RGS conference, and will be anchoring sessions and a social for the upcoming RGS. 
- Francisco has sought sponsorship from the QRMG to revive and/or re-vitalize the QMRG’s “CATMOG” series of short pedagogical books/pamphlets for quantitative geographers. The Committee has endorsed this project, and will collaborate and support Prof. Rowe going forward. 
- We will shortly be seeking nominations for our Conference Officer, Web & Social Media Manager, and Treasurer, as Prof. Emmanouil Tranos & Drs. Mark Green, and Levi John Wolf are all coming to the end of their terms over the coming year. These positions will be advertised widely to the quantitative geographic community.
- The group is actively seeking funding to support the reconvene of RGS QMRG- AAG SAM collaboration after 40 years. Grant has been submitted to various funding agency and we are hoping for good results. 
- We plan to sponsor three sessions in the RGS-IBG 2023 Annual Conference. They are broadly about: (i) Advances in green space and wellbeing research organised by Drs. Wenjing Zhang and Mark Green from University of Liverpool (2 sessions), (ii) Use of new forms of data and mobile phones by Dr. Michael Sinclair from University of Glasgow, and (iii) Our annual ECR led-one that celebrates quantitative research undertaken by postgraduates.
