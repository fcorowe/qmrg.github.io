The RGS-IBG Quantitative Methods Research Group (QMRG) is looking for a new Conference Officer. The role involves coordinating and organising Special Sessions for the RGS-IBG Annual International Conference, as well as engaging with other conferences and helping to maximise quantitative geography representation at them. You will form a key member of the QMRG committee, attending monthly meetings and deciding key strategic decisions on the groups activities. You can read all about our latest special session call for the RGS-IBG annual conference [here](https://qmrg.github.io/blog/2023/01/27/RGS-Sessions-2023).

**How to apply**

Nominations for the available positions may include self-nominations and should be sent along with the name of a seconder and a brief statement of suitability. Please send any questions and nominations to QMRG secretary Dr Qunshan Zhao (email: Qunshan.Zhao@glasgow.ac.uk). 

We are particularly interested in supporting applications that will help diversify the group, especially from social groups and identities that face structural barriers to inclusion in academia. If you would like to informally discuss any of the equality, diversity and inclusivity issues related to the positions, please get in contact with Dr Caitlin Robinson as QMRGâ€™s Diversity and Inclusion Officer (email: caitlin.robinson@bristol.ac.uk). Applications from ECRs are also welcomed and encouraged.

All committee positions normally have a 3-year term. Ideally post-holders will be fellows of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS).
