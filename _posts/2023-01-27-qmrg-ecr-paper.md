We are excited to share a new commentary published in the Geographical Journal, from previous QMRG postgraduate representatives Rachael Sanderson (Newcastle University) and Patrick Ballantyne (University of Liverpool), working in collaboration with nine other Early Career Researchers (ECRs) in quantitative human geography. The paper reflects upon some of the most important, yet overlooked aspects of the ECR experience in quantitative geography, bringing together a diverse range of opinions and experiences to shape a discussion about what it means to be an ECR in quantitative human geography.  
 
The piece is of great significance as quantitative geography continues to be a booming place to do research, yet ECRs continue to face increasing pressure from academy neo-liberalisation, COVID-19 and the recent cost-of-living crisis. We show that there is no clear formula for how to traverse these challenges at this important time in someone's career, with the experiences shaped by 'hidden' turbulences, mentorship and the skills and opportunities available to ECRs. It is hoped that this piece has provided a space to voice these concerns and experiences, providing solidarity to other ECRs, and calling for changes to improve the situation of ECRs, rather than expecting them to adapt to it.
