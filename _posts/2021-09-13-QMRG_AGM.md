The 2021 Quantitative Methods Research group (QMRG) Annual General Meeting (AGM) will take place on **22nd September 3pm GMT**. 

The AGM presents our yearly meeting, open to anyone interested in contributing to QMRG or a member of the group, to discuss progress of the group and opportunities for the group in furthering quantitative geography. We will be confirming new committee posts, reporting progress and activities in the previous year, announcing annual prizes, and having general discussions about our plans for the next year. 

The AGM will take place online using Zoom. If you are looking to attend, **please can you email** either Chair Dani Arribas-Bel (darribas@liverpool.ac.uk) or Secretary Alistair Geddes (A.Y.Geddes@dundee.ac.uk) who will send you the Zoom details/links. This way we can prevent any sneaky zoom bombers from attending.
