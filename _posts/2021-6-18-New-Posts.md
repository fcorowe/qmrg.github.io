We are happy to announce that we are seeking nominations for two positions on the QMRG committee in order to replace current post-holders who are completing their terms. Specifically:

**Secretary** \
Main responsibilities include organising monthly QMRG meetings, liaising with RGS-IBG, and disseminating resources among group members.

**Dissertation Prize Officer** \
Responsible for co-ordinating the annual undergraduate dissertation competition (see above), including advertising the competition, collating submissions, arranging judging. The post-holder will also contribute to the general running of the group. Previous winners of the dissertation prize can be seen [here](https://qmrg.github.io/prizes).

**Deadline for submissions:** 27th August 2021 16:00 GMT 

Nominations for the two available positions may include self-nominations and should be sent along with the name of a seconder and a brief statement of suitability. Please send any questions and nominations to both the QMRG Chair Dr Dani Arribas-Bel (email: d.arribas-bel@liverpool.ac.uk) and QMRG secretary Dr Alistair Geddes (email: A.Y.Geddes@dundee.ac.uk). A vote will take place on each new committee appointment at the 2021 QMRG Annual General Meeting (date to be confirmed, but will be early September).

We are particularly interested in supporting applications that will help diversify the group. If you would like to informally discuss any of the equality, diversity and inclusivity issues related to the positions, please get in contact with Dr Caitlin Robinson as QMRG's Diversity and Inclusion Officer (email: Caitlin.Robinson@liverpool.ac.uk). Applications from ECRs are also welcomed.

All committee positions normally have a 3-year term. Ideally post-holders will be fellows of the Royal Geographical Society.
