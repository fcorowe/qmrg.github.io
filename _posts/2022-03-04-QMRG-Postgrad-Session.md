The Quantitative Methods Research Group (QMRG) is inviting papers from PGRs for the forthcoming RGS-IBG Annual International Conference, which will take place from Tuesday 30th August to Friday 2nd September 2022 at Newcastle University, UK. This session is dedicated to the work of postgraduate students embracing quantitative methods to answer geographical research questions.

We are particularly interested in papers related to this year’s conference theme “Geographies Beyond Recovery” and welcome anything to do with quantitative methods, methodologies, and data. Notably, this applies to both the human and physical sides of the discipline.

All participants of the session are automatically considered for the QMRG’s [Robin Flowerdew Award](https://qmrg.github.io/postgrad_prize) for best postgraduate paper, with the winner announced at the AGM during the conference.

## How to submit your paper

Please send the following information as a Word document to Dr Isabel Williams (Isabel.Williams@newcastle.ac.uk) and/or Rachael Sanderson (R.Sanderson4@newcastle.ac.uk) by 23:59 on Monday 21st March 2022:

* Paper title and abstract (250 words)
* Paper author(s), affiliation(s), and email address(es)

We plan to attend the conference in person and expect this session to run live and in person. We also welcome submissions from colleagues who plan to attend virtually and, if necessary, will explore hybrid session options.

All presenters must register to attend the conference before the early-bird closing date of Friday 17 June 2022, details of which can be found [here]( https://www.rgs.org/research/annual-international-conference/call/guidance-for-presenters/).
