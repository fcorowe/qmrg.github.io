The QMRG offers a prize for the best undergraduate dissertation that engages with quantitative geography. Innovative geographic data science analyses, effective deployments of existing geographical science methods, or fundamental research in spatial models will all be considered.  There is a cash award for the winner(s). Entries are judged by members of the QMRG committee who may, depending on the number and types of entries received, decide to award a single overall prize or multiple separate prizes for different fields of the discipline.
 
Please note that entries are limited to undergraduate dissertations from UK higher education institutions. They should be submitted with the studentâ€™s agreement and by an appropriate member of staff (normally the Head of Department or appointed representative).  Each institution is limited to a single entry.
 
To submit an entry, please email a copy of the dissertation without any indication of awarded mark to: Dr Alistair Geddes (a.y.geddes@dundee.ac.uk).
