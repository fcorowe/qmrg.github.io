Following our Annual General Meeting on the 1st September 2023, we are pleased to announce that we have appointed three new members to the QMRG committee.

Alessia Calafiore
Elisabetta Pietrostefani
Stephen Law

We are sorry to have to say goodbye to three excellent colleagues who have either reached their term limits or moving onto pastures new leading to these positions being vacant. They include our Treasurer Levi Wolf, Social Media and Website Officer Mark Green, and Conferences Officer Emmanouil Tranos. While we are sad to have to say goodbye, we can reflect over the skills, knowledge and energy they each brought to the committee and we thank them all sincerely for their help in promoting quantitative methods in Geography. They have each made significant changes and improvements to how QMRG operates, and their contributions will be missed.
