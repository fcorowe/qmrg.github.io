We are now seeking nominations for two following openings on the QMRG committee in order to replace current post-holders who are completing their terms:
 
* **Group Secretary** – Main responsibilities include organising monthly QMRG meetings, liaising with RGS-IBG, and disseminating resources among group members
 
* **Dissertation prize officer** – responsible for co-ordinating the annual undergraduate dissertation competition (see above), including advertising the competition, collating submissions, arranging judging. The post-holder will also contribute to the general running of the group.
 
All committee positions normally have a 3-year term. Ideally post-holders will be fellows of the Royal Geographical Society-IBG.  We are particularly interested in supporting applications that will help diversify the group.
 
Nominations for the two available positions may include self-nominations and should be sent along with the name of a seconder and a brief statement of suitability.  Please send any questions and nominations to the QMRG Chair, Dr Dani Arribas-Bel ([email](d.arribas-bel@liverpool.ac.uk)). We would like to receive all nominations for both positions no later than Friday 28th August.
 
Please also help us by circulating this notice among your colleagues and students.  Thank you.
