# Prizes

We sponsor and organise a range of prizes to help promote quantitative methods throughout Geography. Specifically, our two main prizes include our long-standing [annual prize for the best undergraduate dissertation](https://qmrg.github.io/dissertation_prize), and the [Robin Flowerdew Award for Best Postgraduate Paper at the RGS-IBG Annual Conference](https://qmrg.github.io/dissertation_prize). We also run ad-hoc prizes at events and other conference sessions that we sponsor or run where relevant.

Check out our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/qmrg_rgs_ibg) or [blog](https://qmrg.github.io/blog) for latest calls.
