# History of QMRG

A full timeline of the QMRG committee can be viewed [here](https://github.com/qmrg/qmrg.github.io/blob/master/files/QMRG_History.xlsx). Since it's inception in 1964, the QMRG has helped to facilitate debates on the future of quantitative geography in the UK. The functioning of QMRG has evolved over time, reflecting both the changing needs of the committee, approaches to dissemination of the group, and priorities in promoting quantitative geography. The plot below summarises the evolution of the roles held on the committee over time (not including positions on the committee held with no formal role).
