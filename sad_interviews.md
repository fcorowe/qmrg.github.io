# SAD - The Interviews

The Spatial Analytics and Data seminar series, brought to you by Newcastle University, Bristol University and The Alan Turing Institute, provides a forum for dialogue among scholars united by interest in geographic data and spatial analysis, as well as a platform for cutting-edge methods and thinking in spatial social science.

Throughout the years, spatial analytics and data have been nurtured by path-breaking scholars from a variety of backgrounds. But, who are these people? What reflections do they have on their experience? How have "Spatial Analytics" and "Data" changed, and what is their future? SAD: The Interviews is a new partnership between the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) through the Quantitative Methods Research Group (QMRG) and the Spatial Analytics and Data (SAD) Seminar Series.

Join us for SAD: The Interviews, long-form, informal conversations with influencers of our generation of spatial analytics and data for their insights on the evolution (and revolutions) of the field. You can sign up for events using the Evenbrite link, or catch up on previous recordings via the youtube link.

We also run seminars to promote excellent research that highlights the importance of spatial analytics and data. You can catch up on these seminars on our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6M30zBbmmEMIOWbeOlfDMlk8pJgGDQGK).
