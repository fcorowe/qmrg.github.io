# SAD - The Interviews

The Spatial Analytics + Data seminar series, brought to you by Newcastle University, Bristol University and The Alan Turing Institute, provides a forum for dialogue among scholars united by interest in geographic data & spatial analysis, as well as a platform for cutting-edge methods and thinking in spatial social science.

Throughout the years, spatial analytics and data have been nurtured by path-breaking scholars from a variety of backgrounds. But, who are these people? What reflections do they have on their experience? How have “Spatial Analytics” and “Data” changed, and what is their future? SAD: The Interviews is a new partnership between the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) through the Quantitative Methods Research Group (QMRG) and the Spatial Analytics and Data (SAD) Seminar Series.

Join us now for SAD: The Interviews, long-form, informal conversations with influencers of our generation of spatial analytics and data for their insights on the evolution (and revolutions) of the field.
